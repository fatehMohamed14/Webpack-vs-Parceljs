# Webpack vs Parcel

## Country search by language and by currency (Typescript, Rxjs, Sass)

The goal of this comparison is not to say that one of them is the best
but which one can fit needs of a small application and the time you have
to do it. I've create a small typescript web application (fetch
countries and search countries by a given spoken language) using Webpack
and the same one using Parcel bundler in order to make a comparaison of
both tools in term of time spent on configuration, build speed, caching,
code splitting...

\
 The apps are separated in 2 sub-directories where you can build each
one and see the result your self, you can add more feature to the
application to see the results for a medium or even a big size
application

### Run dev mode

`npm run dev`

### Build

`npm run build`

### Demo
