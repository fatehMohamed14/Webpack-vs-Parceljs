# Webpack vs Parcel

The goal of this comparison is not to say that one of them is the best
but which one can fit needs of a small application and the time you have
to do it. I've create a small typescript web application (fetch
countries and search countries by a given spoken language) using Webpack
and the same one using Parcel bundler in order to make a comparaison of
both tools in term of time spent on configuration, build speed, caching,
code splitting...

\
 The apps are separated in 2 sub-directories where you can build each
one and see the result your self, you can add more feature to the
application to see the results for a medium or even a big size
application
